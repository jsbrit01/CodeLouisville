//Create an array of student objects
/*
Each student should have the following properties:
-Name
-Track (eg iOS, Web Design, Front End Development, etc)
-Achievements (should hold a # value)
-Points (holds the total points a student has earned)
*/
//Create at least 5 student objects
//Create separate JS file to handle logic; students.js should just contain data

var students = [
  {name: "John", track: "iOS", achievements: 10, points: 100},
  {name: "Jane", track: "Android", achievements: 20, points: 300},
  {name: "Jack", track: "WordPress", achievements: 12, points: 150},
  {name: "Amanda", track: "C#", achievements: 19, points: 220},
  {name: "Dave", track: "Front End Web Development", achievements: 25, points: 500}
